# COMP 3270 (Algorithms) Project

## Course Description
Algorithms for standard computational problems and techniques for analyzing their efficiency; designing efficient algorithms and experimentally evaluating their performance.

## Project Description (Brief Truncated Description)
In this assignment, you will write a program to implement autocomplete for a given set of N terms, where a term is a query string and an associated nonnegative weight. That is, given a prefix, find all queries that start with the given prefix, in descending order of weight.

In this assignment, you will write a class, TrieAutocomplete to implement Autcomplete functionality using a Trie data structure.

You are responsible for completing the following classes:
   * TrieAutocomplete â€“ an implementation of Autocompletor which performs the autocomplete algorithm using trie exploration.

The complete description of the project can be found in the file name titled, '3270 FA 21 Programming Project Description.pdf'

## Files
The most important file for this project that I worked on was the file 'autocomplete-start/src/Autocomplete.java'. I wrote the algorithms for adding/constructing nodes to a Trie, finding the top match for a word stem and find the top k matches for a word stem. I used no references for the part of the project that I was in charge of - all of that code is my own. However, the GUI and the time profiling code was written by the smart folks who authored this project. Their credit is given in the file detailing this projects description found above. This was a **really** cool project, I enjoyed it.
